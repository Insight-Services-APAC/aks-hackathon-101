## Introduction

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox. 

## Description

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

- Install the recommended toolset:
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux
    - Azure CLI 
        - Update to the latest
        - Must be at least version 2.7.x
        - **NOTE:** If youâ€™re running into issues running Azure CLI command on Windows, disable Global Protect (VPN)
    - Visual Studio Code
- **NOTE:** You can start the next challenge even if this one is still running by using the Azure Cloud Shell.
